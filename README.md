# learn-alphabets

#Idea
This is a very simple website aimed at kids(2-5 yrs old).
As kids spend a lot of time on smartphones,laptops and computers this website will help them learn the alphabets and also the pronunciation.

#How it works
-You hit a letter on your keyboard and then screen scrolls down or up,with a voice.
-You click on an image and a transition is added to the image,you hear the voice too.
  say for eg. a for apple. b for bear etc.
 
#Key technologies

-Only a very few taga are used,the goal was to get the data rendered dynamically with the use of Javascript
CSS was used to style the page and make it look better

Javascript
-Javascript is the main language used here.
-Javascript speech synthesis api is used for the sound.
-No external (3rd party ) API is used.
